12 / 23 / 2021

I just realized, I need to relearn data strcutures... because tbh, I don't remember anything.

I will be using this link : // nevermind, i did not like the video, so I'll just find another video
To learn Data Structures and Algorithms

15:10
Data Structures | Binary Search, Linked Lists, and Complexity Anlysis

12:38 (video time)
1. state problem clearly, identify IO formats
2. come with some exampels IO
3. come up with correct solutions for the problem - plain english
4. implement the solution and test using example inputs, fix bugs if anything
5. analyze alg's complexity and identify inefficienies, if anything
6. apply right techinique to overcome the ineff, then repeat 3-6 if you can.
