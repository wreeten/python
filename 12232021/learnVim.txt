Learning Vim :)

:quit or :q << the way to exit vim
typing <esc> switches to normal mode, and if you ':' it will produce : bottom screen.

:write << saves changes
:w file.txt << if this is a new file, this gives it a name before saving it caleld filed.txt

:wq < save and quit < which is a combination of :w and :q command

:q! < this is force quit, and it doesn't save any changes

to open a file, you can do "vim hello.txt" in terminal

you can also open multiple files at once "vim hello1.txt hello2.txt hello3.txt" in separate "buffers"

:s and :substitute < you substitute strings, idk what this does yet tbh.. oh wait, it replaces a striing lol so an example is below v
vim -c %s/john/python/g -c %s/do/re/g -c %s/fa/so/g hello.txt
so what does this do? vim replaces instances of "john" with "python" then replaces "do" with "re" then rplace "fa" with "so". It sounds confusing, but i'll try it out later.

vim -o2, opens vim and two horizonal windows
vim -o5, 5 horizonal windows

vim -5 hello1.txt hello2.txt fills up 5 horizontal windows and then fill up two with the txt file hello1 and hello2.

to suspend vim, press ctrl + z, or :stop or :suspend
to return to suspended vim, run 'fg' in terminal
